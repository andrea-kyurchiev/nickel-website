Oisín has worked with Open Source as a developer, contributor and as a software executive responsible for policy and licensing at company-wide level. He spent time as a Project Lead and member of the Board of Directors for the Eclipse Foundation, and worked with the Apache Foundation as part of the FuseSource open source enterprise service bus effort initiated by IONA Technologies, which was then acquired by Progress and Redhat. Shifting to a non-developer role, he set policy for open source development and use at Swrve, and when at Activision Blizzard King he re-invented the Open Source program, working with Legal and IP to streamline approvals, allowing teams to ship Open Source project updates that had been in limbo for up to years. He is strong in his belief that Open Source is an incredible resource, and needs to be nurtured and encouraged by both corporations and nations.
