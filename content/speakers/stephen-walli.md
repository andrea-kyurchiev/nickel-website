I'm a principal program manager at Microsoft in the Azure Office of the CTO. I was technical director at the Outercurve Foundation, and an open source software start-up founder. I've been around open source software for 35+ years. I'm presently Microsoft Strategic Board member to the Eclipse Foundation, steering committee chair for Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle WG, Board alternate for the Linux Foundation Board, and governing board member for the Confidential Computing Consortium. I am adjunct faculty at Carnegie Mellon University teaching open source software engineering.
