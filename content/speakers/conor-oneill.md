Conor Oâ€™Neill has spent decades at the forefront of new technologies from mobile to AI. His open source journey began as a user in 1992 with GNU tools and eventually led to launching the first open source smartwatch powered by machine learning in 2019 and a groundbreaking performance tool for Node.js.

He has worked with some of Ireland's biggest startup success stories including S3, Integral Design, FeedHenry (Red Hat), NearForm, Tines and now ServisBOT.

In ServisBOT, like with much of his career, he focuses on wrangling powerful new tech into useful products for businesses. Working with the ServisBOT teams in Product, Engineering and Bot Building, Conor is leading the charge in getting the incredible capabilities of LLMs safely into production so they can solve real-world problems for customers. 

When he's not talking about AI, Open Source or IOT, you can usually find him ankle deep in mud, running on Irish trails and mountains.
