Kathryn Lynch is a purpose-driven strategist who excels at turning complex challenges into actionable solutions. As CEO and Founder of Chronos Consulting, she's like a business architect – designing future-ready operating models that help organisations thrive in an evolving landscape.
Her influence extends far beyond her consultancy. As Vice-Chair of Innovate Island and National Chair of the Fine Gael Small Business & Enterprise Council, she champions Ireland's SME sector. Her expertise has earned her seats at pivotal tables, from the Public Service Innovation Advisory Board to the EU Working Group for Industry/Academia Collaboration, where she brings a much-needed industry perspective to academic discussions.
A firm believer in continuous learning, Kathryn holds two master's degrees – One in Strategy & Innovation and most recently completing an MSc in Sustainable Enterprise, where her research spotlighted women's leadership in sustainability. Her earlier work on Open Innovation in Irish Tech SMEs posed the provocative question: "If everybody's doing it, why aren't we?"
Armed with advanced qualifications in executive coaching and emotional intelligence, Kathryn brings a uniquely holistic approach to business transformation. She combines strategic insight with deep understanding of human dynamics, helping organisations navigate change while building resilient, forward-thinking teams.
